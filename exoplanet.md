# Exoplanet data analysis
Exoplanet data analysis involves the study and interpretation of data collection from observations of exoplanets, which are planets located outside our solar system. Astronomers use various methods to detect  and characterize exoplanets,
and the analysis of resulting data provides insights into the properties, atmoshpheres, and overall characteristics of these distant worlds.

Here is an overview of the key steps and techniuqes involved in exoplanet data analysis :
1. Light curve analysis - Analyzing the light curve, a plot of a star's brightness over time, to identify patterns indicative of exoplanet transits.
2. Radial velocity analysis - Extracting radial velocity measurements from the spectrum of a star to detect periodic shifts caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting exoplanet.
